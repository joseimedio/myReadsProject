# MyReads Project (React)
This project was completed as a part of the React Nanodegree Program (Udacity) in September 2022 by Jos√© Imedio.

It consists on a virtual bookshelf where the user can classify a series of books into three categories: Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read. There's also a simulated database, provided by Udacity, that provides the app with dozens of additional books, so the user can add new elements to the bookshelf.

## Instructions
To launch the app:
- install all project dependencies with 'npm install'
- start the development server in '/src' with 'npm start'

## Content
- README.md
- package-lock.json 
- package.json 
- yarn.lock
#### public 
HTML and a favicon
#### src 
Source code

## The src folder
- index.js: initializes the React app. 
#### icons 
SVG icons
#### css
- index.css: global styles. 
- App.css: styles for the App.
#### utils
- BooksAPI.js:  JavaScript API for the provided Udacity backend. 
- bookshelves.js: contains an array with the name of the three bookshelves. It's used throughout the whole app. 
#### components
- App.js: Root of the App. Fetches the saved books from the server. Also contains the routes to Landing Page and Search Page.
- LandingPage.js: Paints the bookshelves by mapping over bookshelves.js and returning a Bookshelf component every time.
- Bookshelf.js: Returns a BooksGrid component. 
- SearchPage.js: Handles the user input on the search bar and generates a search term that is sent to SearchBooksResults.js. 
- SearchBooksResults.js: Fetches books from the server according to the search term received.
- BooksGrid.js: Maps over the prop 'books' and returns a Book component every time. 
- Book.js: Paints the book received. Adds a checkmark on the dropdown menu if the current book was already saved.
        
## Possible improvements
When searching for books in the backend, the search terms are very limited and the behavior of the search tool is not really intuitive.

The basic website (HTML and CSS) and the simulated book database were provided by Udacity, Inc.
